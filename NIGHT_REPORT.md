## Data downloaded from ASF

Running total: 0 GB of the 20 GB budget.

## Files the plan expected that are missing

`CLAUDE.md` is not at the repo root (it is at `docs/CLAUDE (1).md`, which I read). `pipeline/notebooks/nisar_albay_starter.ipynb`, `pipeline/legacy/` and `docs/notes/` do not exist in the repo, so all pipeline logic was written from the docs and from inspecting real products. The granule names come from the examples in `docs/06-api-spec.md`.

## Assumptions

- T-006: `contract_check` rejects fields not in 05 ("exactly the column names in 05").
- T-006: `previous_pair_id` is checked for format only, not for presence in `pairs.json`. The baseline pair may be processed but not published, as with the reference pair tonight.
- T-006: a pair without coherence may omit the `coherence_loss` layer, because there is nothing to draw. 06 says a real pair has 5 layers but doesn't cover this case.
- T-006: `ci.yml` skips pushes to `main` because `deploy.yml` calls the same checks for those. Every push is still checked once.
